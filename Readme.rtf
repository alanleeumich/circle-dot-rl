In this project, a neural network is trained to play the game "circle the dot" using the algorithm deep q-learning. The game itself has been 
implemented from scratch, and includes a pathfinding algorithm. The neural network was imported from tensorflow, while the q-learning algorithm 
was implemented.

game.py: Run to play the game yourself
test_deep_q.py: Run to see the model play the game

deep_qlearning: Continues training the model.

board.py: Base code for the game
